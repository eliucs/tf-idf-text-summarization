# tf-idf Text Summarization

In natural language processing and information retrieval systems, [text 
summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization), 
which is the process of creating a shortened or abridged version of a text, 
becomes an important goal because it allows for unnecessary or extraneous 
aspects of the text to be removed, only leaving the key points of the 
original text.
